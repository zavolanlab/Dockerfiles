# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel 
free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute?

- Report bugs
- Propose or implement features
- Submit code changes / fixes
- Discuss code

See here for a [short tutorial for GitHub's issue tracking system](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs

Please use the project's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/zavolanlab/Dockerfiles/issues) to report bugs. If you have no experience in filing bug reports, see e.g.,
[these recommendations by the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)
first. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail,
background and, if applicable, _minimal_ reproducible sample code. Tell us
what you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.

## Implementing features and submitting fixes

Kindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note
that this project is driven by a community that likes to act on consensus. So
in your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request after a lot of
work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/zavolanlab/Dockerfiles/issues) to **discuss your proposed changes first**. 
Afterwards, please stick to the following simple rules to make sure your 
pull request will indeed be merged:


1. Fork the repo and create a [_feature branch_](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) from branch `master` 
    or create a [_feature branch_](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) from branch `master` if you are already a member of the group
2. To add a new Dockerfile, please follow the directory structure/naming conventions
`(<root_dir>/<tool_name>/<version>/Dockerfile)`
3. Please stick to the code and documentation style
4. Try to make minimal your container
5. Document your code and update all relevant documentation
6. Issue a pull request

Don't forget to add your name and profile URL to the [list of contributors](contributors.md).
