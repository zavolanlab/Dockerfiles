# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. These
are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How to contribute

- Report bugs
- Propose or implement features
- Submit code changes / fixes
- Discuss code

See here for a [short tutorial on GitHub's issue tracking
system](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs

Please use the project's [issue
tracker](https://github.com/zavolanlab/Dockerfiles/issues) to report bugs. If
you have no experience in filing bug reports, see e.g., [these recommendations
by the Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)
first. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail,
background and, if applicable, _minimal_ reproducible sample code. Tell us
what you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.

## Implementing features and submitting fixes

Kindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note
that this project is driven by a community that likes to act on consensus. So
in your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request after a lot of
work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/zavolanlab/Dockerfiles/issues)
to **discuss your proposed changes first**.

Afterwards, please stick to the following simple rules to make sure your
pull request will indeed be merged:
